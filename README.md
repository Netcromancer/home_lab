# Home Lab (*Working Project Name*)

The intent of this project is to create a way to deploy a home setup in a modular fashion. Each piece should be deployable without any requirements, aside from the base installation. Below is a working list of targets for inclusion in this project. The aim is to find free/free-ish replacements for services that are common in most homes. While there may be cost for hardware or media, everything should be owned by the user and should not require a recurring subscription in order to access the content or service.

##Targeted Services

- Cloud Servers
- Streaming Media (Netflix, Spotify, etc)
- Home Assistant (Alexa, Google Home)
- Security/Home Monitoring
- Storage

  Each service will be its own module and may be partitioned further depending on size and scope. At this time, the intent is to use Terraform or Ansible to create playbooks for each piece.

  There will be a networking guide as well, should a user want to set up a similar network topology to what will be used when this is completed. The basic design will be added when completed and will be altered as the design of the project changes.
