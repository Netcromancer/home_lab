# Home Lab (*Working Project Name*)

The intent of this project is to create a way to deploy a home setup in a modular fashion. Each piece should be deployable without any requirements, aside from the base installation. Below is a working list of targets for inclusion in this project. The aim is to find free/free-ish replacements for services that are common in most homes. While there may be cost for hardware or media, everything should be owned by the user and should not require a recurring subscription in order to access the content or service.

##Targeted Services

-Cloud Servers
-Streaming Media (Netflix, Spotify, etc)
-Home Assistant (Alexa, Google Home)
-Security/Home Monitoring
-Storage
